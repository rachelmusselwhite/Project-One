# Project-One
 

   # Title
    A Comparison of Minimum Wage Across Three States
   # My goals
    My goal in this project was to practice scraping data from a website and building my first datawrapper chart. To do this, I chose a simple topic of comparing the minimum wage across three states I've lived in
   # Findings
    I found that the minimum wage hac changed very little of the past three years in these states (Alaska, California, Florida). No state has increased their minimum wage by more than a dollar in the past three years.
   # Data Collection
    I used wikipedia to scrape the table data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_US_states_by_minimum_wage). I checked the data with the DOl's historical table (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/history)
   # Analysis
    I didn't do any analysis in Jupyter for this project. I was unsure about how to clean up all the data appropriately; in the future, this is something I would like to work on for this project.
   # New Skills
     My first time scraping something from a webpage all by myself! And, making something in datawrapper. This was a very small project, but I wanted to try to work through this on my own and figure out the code. It did involve some troubleshooting, which I was able to accomplish and create a dataframe from the information I scraped.
   # Things I would improve on
   I would take the time to add a table that had the previous years (2019 - 2021) so I could've included that data too. In addition, I would've liked to compare the minimum wage to other financial markers and how they've changed over the years: cost of living, cost of home purchase, average rent, etc.
